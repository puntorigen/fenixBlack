```TASK:
Your task is to research the company www.enecon.com, understand their business, identify their brand colors, fonts, and other design elements.

I am researching www.enecon.com to gather info on their business, brand colors, fonts, and design elements. I am reading their website now.

I have gathered info from the ENECON website. I am identifying their logo, colors, typography, layout, and design rules. I am searching for ENECON brand guidelines online.

I see the search results don't have brand guidelines or visual identity docs. I'm looking on the ENECON website in 'About Us,' 'Media,' or brochures.
---
I gather design elements like the logo, colors, typography, and layout from the ENECON website. I search sections like 'About Us' and 'Media.'
---
I search the ENECON website for brand colors but find nothing specific. I am now looking in sections like 'About Us,' 'Media,' or brochures for the logo, color palette, typography, and layout principles. I search for 'typography' on https://www.enecon.com.
