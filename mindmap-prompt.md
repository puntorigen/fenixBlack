I encountered an error while trying to use the tool. This was the error: 'PDFSearchTool' object has no attribute 'query'.
 Tool Search a PDF's content accepts these inputs: Search a PDF's content(query: 'string', pdf: 'string') - A tool that can be used to semantic search a query from a PDF's content..
Moving on then. I MUST either use a tool (use one at time) OR give my best final answer. To Use the following format:

Thought: you should always think about what to do
Action: the action to take, should be one of [Search the internet, Read website content, Search in a specific website, Search a PDF's content, Search a Youtube Video content]
Action Input: the input to the action, dictionary enclosed in curly braces
Observation: the result of the action
... (this Thought/Action/Action Input/Observation can repeat N times)
Thought: I now can give a great answer
Final Answer: my best complete final answer to the task.
Your final answer must be the great and the most complete as possible, it must be outcome described
